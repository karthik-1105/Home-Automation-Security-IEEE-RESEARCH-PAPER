Abstract:

This technology provides new and exciting opportunities to increase the property of devices at intervals the house for the aim of home automation. 
Mobile devices are ideal for providing a program to a home automation system due to its wide array of movability and capabilities.
They'll communicate with a home automation network through an internet entree, however cannot communicate directly with devices within the network,
as these devices usually implement low power communication protocols, like Zig-Bee, WiFi, etc. During this project we are geared towards dominant home appliances. 
The device uses Wi-Fi because the communication protocol and Raspberry Pi acts as a server system.
We tend to supply a simple interface for the device that allows the user to interact with the Raspberry Pi server. 
The servers are interfered with a relay board that controls the devices running within the house. The server communicates with the individual relay. 
By this we provide a reliable and price effective home automation system.
